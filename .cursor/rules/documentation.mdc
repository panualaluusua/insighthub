# Documentation Standards (Core Rule)

- Follow established style guides and conventions for Markdown and diagrams.
- Use templates and reusable components to ensure consistency.
- Review and revise documentation regularly to keep it up-to-date.
- Get feedback from users and incorporate it into the documentation.
- Use clear, descriptive headings and code blocks with language specification.
- Prefer practical examples and diagrams for complex concepts.
- **Document only after using @reflect.md to capture learnings and avoid hindering development.**

### DO / DON'T Examples
```markdown
# ✅ DO: Write documentation after reflecting on the task with @reflect.md
# ❌ DON'T: Interrupt development flow to document before reflection
# ✅ DO: Use code blocks with language tags
```python
print('Hello, world!')
```
# ❌ DON'T: Omit language tags in code blocks
```
print('Hello, world!')
```
```
