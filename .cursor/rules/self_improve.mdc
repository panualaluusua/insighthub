# Rule Self-Improvement Process

**This rule defines how to continuously improve and maintain all other rules in this project.**

## Key Principles
- **Monitor for new code patterns, repeated issues, or emerging best practices.**
- **Add new rules when new technologies, patterns, or recurring bugs are identified.**
- **Update rules when better examples, new edge cases, or related rules change.**
- **Deprecate or remove rules that are outdated or no longer relevant.**
- **Keep documentation, examples, and cross-references up to date.**

### DO / DON'T Examples
```markdown
# ✅ DO: Add a new rule when a new library is used in 3+ files
# ❌ DON'T: Ignore repeated code review feedback about missing standards
# ✅ DO: Update rules with better examples from real code
# ❌ DON'T: Let rules become outdated after major refactors
```

## Maintenance Notes
- **Review this rule after major releases, refactors, or when new patterns emerge.**
- **Encourage all contributors to suggest rule updates.**
- **Cross-reference new or updated rules as needed.**
