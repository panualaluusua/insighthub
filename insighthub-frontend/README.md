### AI Testing Commands

#### Core AI Testing
```bash
# Run complete AI-powered visual analysis
npm run test:ai

# Run AI tests with browser UI for debugging
npm run test:ai:headed

# Run targeted AI bug detection
npm run test:bug-detection

# Generate comprehensive AI analysis report
npm run analyze:ai

# View detailed AI test reports
npx playwright show-report
```

#### Cursor IDE Integration
```bash
# 🎯 Use this command in Cursor for comprehensive AI analysis
@test-ai-analyze
```

### What the AI Testing System Does

#### 1. 🧠 **AI Visual Analysis**
- Takes intelligent screenshots of all UI states
- Analyzes visual patterns for consistency
- Detects layout shifts and design anomalies
- Validates component behavior across states

#### 2. 🔍 **AI Bug Detection**
- Pattern recognition for common UI issues
- Intelligent form validation analysis
- Cross-browser compatibility insights
- Performance bottleneck identification

#### 3. ♿ **AI Accessibility Analysis**
- Automated WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
- Intelligent accessibility recommendations
- Keyboard navigation validation
- Screen reader compatibility analysis

#### 4. 📱 **AI Responsive Design Testing**
- Multi-viewport behavior analysis
- Breakpoint transition validation
- Mobile-first design verification
- Cross-device compatibility testing

#### 5. ⚡ **AI Performance Monitoring**
- Core Web Vitals analysis with AI insights
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Bundle size impact assessment
- Load time optimization suggestions

### AI Test Results

After running AI tests, results are saved to:
```
test-results/ai-analysis/
├── bug-detection-report.md       # 🤖 Comprehensive AI analysis
├── component-visual-*.png         # 📷 Visual evidence
├── responsive-*.png               # 📱 Responsive validation
├── accessibility-report.json      # ♿ AI accessibility findings
└── performance-analysis.md        # ⚡ AI performance insights
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

#### During Component Development
1. **After implementing a component**: Run `@test-ai-analyze`
2. **When adding variants**: Use AI visual analysis for consistency
3. **Before committing**: Verify AI accessibility compliance

#### During Feature Development
1. **After UI changes**: Run AI visual regression tests
2. **When implementing responsive design**: Use AI viewport analysis
3. **Before deployment**: Execute complete AI testing suite

#### For Bug Investigation
1. **When tests fail**: Review AI-generated bug reports
2. **For accessibility issues**: Follow AI recommendations
3. **For performance problems**: Implement AI optimization suggestions

### AI Testing Best Practices

#### ✅ DO:
- Run `npm run test:ai` after any UI changes
- Review AI-generated screenshots for visual validation
- Follow AI accessibility recommendations immediately
- Use `@test-ai-analyze` for comprehensive component analysis
- Check AI performance insights regularly

#### ❌ DON'T:
- Ignore AI-detected accessibility violations
- Skip AI testing before major releases
- Dismiss AI performance recommendations
- Forget to update tests when adding new UI patterns
