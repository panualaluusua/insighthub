# Product Requirements Document: LLM-Powered Content Scoring and Summarization

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for an LLM-powered system that analyzes content, generates relevance scores based on user profiles, and provides personalized content filtering. This system is a core component of the InsightHub platform, aiming to deliver a highly personalized and relevant content experience to users. It solves the problem of information overload by surfacing content that aligns with a user's specific interests and expertise.

## Core Features

*   **LLM-based Content Analysis and Scoring:**
    *   **What it does:** Analyzes content from sources like YouTube and Reddit against a user's profile to generate a relevance score (0-100), a list of relevant categories, an explanation for the score, and a concise summary.
    *   **Why it's important:** This is the core of the personalization engine, ensuring users see content that matters to them.
    *   **How it works:** A `ContentAnalyzer` class will use LangChain and an OpenAI model to process content and user data, returning a structured `ContentRelevance` object.

*   **Personalized Content Filtering:**
    *   **What it does:** Filters the incoming content feed, showing only items that meet a minimum relevance threshold.
    *   **Why it's important:** Prevents users from being overwhelmed by irrelevant content, improving engagement.
    *   **How it works:** A `ContentFilter` class will use the `ContentAnalyzer` to score a list of content items and return only those that pass the relevance threshold.

*   **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   **What it does:** Allows users to provide feedback (e.g., like/dislike) on content, which then updates their user profile.
    *   **Why it's important:** Continuously improves the accuracy of the personalization algorithm over time.
    *   **How it works:** A `FeedbackProcessor` will adjust the weights of a user's interests in their profile based on their interactions.

## User Experience

*   **User Personas:** The primary user is a professional or enthusiast who wants to stay up-to-date on specific topics without wading through irrelevant noise.
*   **Key User Flows:**
    1.  User onboards and defines their interests.
    2.  User browses a personalized feed of content.
    3.  User consumes content and provides feedback (likes/dislikes).
    4.  The system learns from feedback and further refines the feed.
*   **UI/UX Considerations:** The UI should clearly display the relevance score and summary for each piece of content. Feedback mechanisms should be simple and intuitive.

## Technical Architecture

*   **System Components:**
    *   `ContentAnalyzer`: Python class using LangChain and OpenAI.
    *   `ContentFilter`: Python class to filter content lists.
    *   `FeedbackProcessor`: Python class to handle user feedback.
    *   `ContentScorer`: Orchestrator node to integrate the analyzer.
*   **Data Models:**
    *   `UserProfile`: Pydantic model for user preferences.
    *   `ContentRelevance`: Pydantic model for the output of the analysis.
*   **APIs and Integrations:**
    *   OpenAI API for LLM access.
    *   Supabase for storing user profiles and content metadata.
    *   Integration with existing YouTube and Reddit data pipelines.
*   **Infrastructure Requirements:** Standard Python environment with necessary libraries. No major infrastructure changes are required.

## Development Roadmap

*   **MVP Requirements:**
    1.  Implement the `UserProfile` and `ContentRelevance` Pydantic models.
    2.  Build the core `ContentAnalyzer` class.
    3.  Develop the `ContentFilter` and integrate it into the existing content pipelines.
    4.  Update the `ContentScorer` orchestrator node.
    5.  Modify the database schema to store relevance scores.

*   **Future Enhancements:**
    1.  Implement the `FeedbackProcessor` to enable the user feedback loop.
    2.  Develop a more sophisticated user interest model.
    3.  Add support for more content sources.
    4.  Explore different LLMs for analysis.

## Logical Dependency Chain

1.  **Foundation:** The `UserProfile` and `ContentRelevance` models must be defined first, as they are the data contracts for the system.
2.  **Core Logic:** The `ContentAnalyzer` is the next critical piece, as it contains the core intelligence.
3.  **Integration:** The `ContentFilter` can then be built, followed by its integration into the YouTube and Reddit processors and the orchestrator.
4.  **Persistence:** The database schema must be updated to store the output of the analysis.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The `FeedbackProcessor` can be built last, as it is an enhancement to the core filtering functionality.

## Risks and Mitigations

*   **Technical Challenges:**
    *   **Risk:** The LLM may not provide consistently accurate relevance scores.
    *   **Mitigation:** Extensive testing with a diverse set of content and user profiles. Fine-tuning prompts and potentially the model itself.
*   **MVP Scope:**
    *   **Risk:** The MVP scope could become too large.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to the defined MVP requirements and defer enhancements to a later phase.
*   **Resource Constraints:**
    *   **Risk:** OpenAI API costs could be higher than expected.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement caching for content analysis results. Monitor API usage closely and optimize where possible.

## Appendix

*   **Research Findings:** Initial research indicates that using LangChain with Pydantic output parsers is an effective way to get structured, reliable data from LLMs. The key is well-crafted prompts that clearly define the desired output format.
*   **Technical Specifications:** The detailed implementation plan can be found in the Taskmaster task description for ID #34.
