*   Human-in-the-loop processes

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Workflow Definition
The Content Orchestrator SHALL define content processing workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) using LangGraph. This will involve defining a graph structure in `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.py` that connects various processing nodes.

### FR2: Node Execution
The Content Orchestrator SHALL execute individual processing steps (nodes) within the defined workflow. Each node will be implemented as a Python function or class method, accepting and returning the `ContentOrchestratorState`.

*   **FR2.1: Fetching Content Node:** This node will integrate with existing `src/youtube_processor.py` and `src/reddit_processor.py` to fetch raw content. It should update the `raw_content` and `content_type` fields in the state.
*   **FR2.2: YouTube Transcription Node (Future Enhancement):** This node will utilize the transcription capabilities in `src/youtube_processor.py` (supporting OpenAI Whisper API and Faster-Whisper) to transcribe YouTube video content. It should update the `transcription` field in the state. This node will be conditionally executed based on `content_type`.
*   **FR2.3: Content Embedding Node:** This node will adapt the logic from `src/orchestrator/nodes/embedding.py` to generate vector embeddings of the `raw_content` or `transcription` using `langchain_openai.OpenAIEmbeddings`. It should update the `embedding` field in the state.
*   **FR2.4: Content Summarization Node:** This node will adapt the logic from `src/orchestrator/nodes/summarizer.py` to generate summaries of the `raw_content` or `transcription` using `langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI`. It should update the `summary` field in the state.

### FR3: State Management
The Content Orchestrator SHALL maintain and pass a shared state between nodes, ensuring context is preserved throughout the workflow. The state will be defined as a `TypedDict` in `src/orchestrator/state.py` with fields such as:
*   `content_url` (str): The URL of the content being processed.
*   `content_type` (str): Type of content (e.g., "youtube", "reddit").
*   `raw_content` (Optional[str]): The raw fetched text content.
*   `transcription` (Optional[str]): Transcription of video content.
*   `summary` (Optional[str]): Summarized content.
*   `embedding` (Optional[List[float]]): Vector embedding of the content.
*   `error` (Optional[str]): Stores any error messages during processing.
*   `status` (str): Current status of the workflow (e.g., "pending", "fetching", "transcribing", "summarizing", "embedding", "completed", "failed").

### FR4: Conditional Logic
The Content Orchestrator SHALL support conditional transitions between nodes based on the workflow state or specific processing outcomes. For example, the transcription node should only be triggered if `content_type` is "youtube". This will be implemented using LangGraph's conditional edges.

### FR5: Error Handling
The Content Orchestrator SHALL implement robust error handling mechanisms, including retry logic and circuit breaker patterns, for individual nodes and the overall workflow. This includes:
*   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement configurable retry strategies (e.g., exponential backoff) for transient errors (e.g., network issues, API rate limits).
*   **Circuit Breaker:** Utilize a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to services experiencing repeated failures.
*   **Node-level Error Handling:** Implement `try-except` blocks within each node to catch and log exceptions, updating the `error` field in the `ContentOrchestratorState` upon failure.
*   **Fallback Strategies:** Define error paths or fallback nodes within the LangGraph to manage failures gracefully (e.g., skip embedding if summarization fails, or mark workflow as "failed").

### FR6: LangSmith Integration
The Content Orchestrator SHALL integrate seamlessly with LangSmith for comprehensive observability:
*   **FR6.1: Tracing:** Utilize `@traceable` decorators from `langsmith` on each LangGraph node and the main orchestrator workflow function to enable detailed tracing of execution paths, inputs, and outputs.
*   **FR6.2: Logging:** Ensure relevant inputs, outputs, and metadata (e.g., model used, content length, processing time) are logged to LangSmith for each step.
*   **FR6.3: Monitoring:** Leverage LangSmith to monitor workflow performance, identify bottlenecks, and debug issues efficiently. This includes setting up custom tags for filtering and analysis.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
*   **Scalability:** The orchestrator SHALL be able to handle an increasing volume of content processing tasks without significant degradation in performance.
*   **Efficiency:** Processing times for individual content items SHALL be optimized to minimize latency. Consider parallel execution for independent tasks.

### NFR2: Reliability
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The orchestrator SHALL be resilient to failures in individual nodes or external dependencies, with appropriate retry mechanisms and fallback strategies.
*   **Data Integrity:** The orchestrator SHALL ensure the integrity of processed content throughout the workflow.

### NFR3: Maintainability
*   **Modularity:** The design SHALL promote modularity, allowing for easy addition, modification, or removal of processing nodes.
*   **Readability:** The LangGraph definitions and associated code SHALL be clear, well-documented, and easy to understand.
*   **Testability:** Individual nodes and the overall workflow SHALL be easily testable.

### NFR4: Security
*   **API Key Management:** Secure handling of API keys for external services (e.g., OpenAI, LangSmith).
*   **Data Privacy:** Adherence to data privacy regulations for content being processed.

## 6. Architecture and Design Considerations

### 6.1 LangGraph Structure
*   **Nodes:** Each distinct processing step (e.g., fetch, transcribe, embed, summarize) will be implemented as a separate LangGraph node.
*   **Edges:** Edges will define the flow between nodes, including conditional edges for dynamic routing.
*   **State:** A `TypedDict` will define the shared state object, containing all necessary information passed between nodes.

### 6.2 Integration with Existing Components
*   The orchestrator will interact with existing `youtube_processor.py` and `reddit_processor.py` for content fetching.
*   Existing embedding and summarization logic will be adapted into LangGraph nodes.

### 6.3 LangSmith Integration
*   Utilize `@traceable` decorators for nodes and the main workflow function.
*   Pass relevant metadata to LangSmith for enhanced observability.

### 6.4 Error Handling Strategy
*   Implement `try-except` blocks within nodes to catch and handle exceptions.
*   Define error states or paths within the LangGraph to manage failures gracefully.

### 6.5 Optimization Pipeline
*   The orchestrator includes an optional optimization pipeline (`enable_optimizations` flag) that can route content processing through an optimized execution path. This pipeline aims to improve efficiency and performance, potentially by leveraging alternative processing strategies or parallel execution for certain tasks.

## 7. Open Questions / Future Considerations

*   How will the orchestrator handle long-running processes or large content volumes (e.g., batch processing)?
*   What are the specific requirements for human-in-the-loop interventions?
*   How will the orchestrator integrate with a persistent storage layer for processed content?
*   Detailed design of the `TypedDict` for the workflow state.
