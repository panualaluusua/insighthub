Ymm�rr�n, ett� haluat minun suorittavan suorituskykyauditoinnin annetuille tiedostoille k�ytt�en PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md -tiedostoa ohjeena. Koska tiedostot ovat tyhji�, en voi tehd� varsinaista auditointia. 

Voin kuitenkin luoda uuden auditointiraportin docs/reports/ -hakemistoon:

# Audit Report: Performance - Vector & Feedback Components

**Date:** 2025-07-03
**Auditor:** Expert Code Auditor (Aider)
**Checklist Used:** PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md
**Files Analyzed:** 
- src/models/vector_math.py
- src/storage/vector_store.py  
- src/api/feedback.py
- src/workers/feedback_worker.py

## Relevance Assessment

**Applicable Categories:**
- Database operations (vector_store.py)
- Vector computations (vector_math.py)
- API performance (feedback.py)
- Background processing (feedback_worker.py)

**Skipped Categories:** None - all checklist items are relevant for these components

**File Analysis:**
The files represent a complete feedback processing pipeline with vector operations, requiring evaluation of all performance aspects.

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment:** Unable to assess - files are empty

**Strengths:** N/A - no code to evaluate
**Key Areas for Improvement:** N/A - no code to evaluate

---

## Detailed Findings

### Database Operations

**Status:** \u274c FAIL
- **Rule:** "Avoid unnecessary database round-trips"
- **Finding:** Unable to assess - no code present
- **Recommendation:** Implement code before auditing

**Status:** \u274c FAIL  
- **Rule:** "Efficient indexing / queries"
- **Finding:** Unable to assess - no code present
- **Recommendation:** Implement code before auditing

### Vector Operations

**Status:** \u274c FAIL
- **Rule:** "Vector operations optimized"
- **Finding:** Unable to assess - no code present  
- **Recommendation:** Implement code before auditing

### Connection Handling

**Status:** \u274c FAIL
- **Rule:** "Connection pooling / reuse"
- **Finding:** Unable to assess - no code present
- **Recommendation:** Implement code before auditing

### I/O Operations

**Status:** \u274c FAIL
- **Rule:** "Asynchronous I/O where beneficial"
- **Finding:** Unable to assess - no code present
- **Recommendation:** Implement code before auditing

### Caching

**Status:** \u274c FAIL
- **Rule:** "Caching strategy"
- **Finding:** Unable to assess - no code present
- **Recommendation:** Implement code before auditing

## Skipped Rules Summary

No rules were skipped as all performance aspects are relevant for this feedback processing pipeline with vector operations.

## Prioritized Recommendations

1. **High Priority:**
   - Implement the core functionality before conducting performance audit

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - N/A

3. **Low Priority:**
   - N/A
