Ymm�rr�n, ett� minun pit�isi toimia koodin auditoijana ja tuottaa yksityiskohtainen auditointiraportti. Kuitenkin huomaan, ett� annetut tiedostot ovat tyhji�:

- src\models\vector_math.py
- src\storage\vector_store.py  
- src\api\feedback.py
- src\workers\feedback_worker.py
- docs\audits\SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md

Jotta voisin suorittaa perusteellisen auditoinnin, tarvitsen:

1. Tiedostojen todellisen sis�ll�n
2. K�ytett�v�n tarkistuslistan (SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md)

Voisitko lis�t� n�m� tiedostot chattiin niiden todellisella sis�ll�ll�? Kun saan ne, voin suorittaa tarkan auditoinnin ja tuottaa yksityiskohtaisen raportin pyydetyss� Markdown-muodossa.
