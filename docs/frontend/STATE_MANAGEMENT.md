# Frontend State Management

This document outlines the approach to state management in the InsightHub SvelteKit frontend.

*(This is a placeholder. This should be updated to describe the stores used, how data flows between components, and any libraries or patterns employed for managing state.)*

## Core Principles

-   **Svelte Stores:** We primarily use Svelte's built-in stores (`writable`, `readable`, `derived`) for managing reactive state.
-   **Component-level State:** For state that is local to a single component, we use standard component variables.

*As the application grows, a more structured approach to global state management may be required. This could involve the creation of a `src/lib/stores` directory to house shared stores.*
