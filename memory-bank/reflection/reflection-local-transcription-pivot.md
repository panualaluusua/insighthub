# Reflection on Pivoting to a Local Transcription Architecture

## Task Description
The task was to implement a reliable method for transcribing YouTube videos. The initial approach used the `youtube-transcript-api` library, which proved to be unstable. We pivoted to a more robust, local-first architecture using `yt-dlp` for audio extraction and `faster-whisper` for transcription.

## What Went Well?
- **Systematic Debugging:** Our strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) process was crucial. The unit tests proved our code was correct, which allowed us to definitively isolate the problem to the external `youtube-transcript-api` library after a final live test failed.
- **Decisive Pivot:** Once the root cause was identified, we quickly researched and evaluated alternatives, leading to a decisive and well-justified pivot to the local architecture.
- **Successful Implementation:** The new pipeline was implemented efficiently using the same TDD methodology, resulting in a robust and test-covered solution.

## What Were the Biggest Challenges?
The primary challenge was the unreliability of the `youtube-transcript-api`. It returned frequent, non-deterministic network errors that consumed significant development time while we mistakenly tried to debug our own implementation. This highlights the risk of building core functionality on top of free, scraping-based external APIs.

## What Did We Learn?
1.  **Prioritize Reliability for Core Features:** For a core feature like transcription, relying on an unstable external API is a significant architectural risk. A local-first or self-hosted solution provides far greater control and predictability.
2.  **The Value of TDD in Isolation:** TDD allowed us to trust our own code. When the unit-tested code failed in a live environment, it gave us the confidence to blame the external dependency rather than continuing to search for non-existent bugs in our own logic.
3.  **Local Models are Viable:** We learned that modern local models like `faster-whisper` offer a powerful, cost-effective, and offline-capable alternative to paid cloud services, making them an excellent choice for this project.

## What Would We Do Differently Next Time?
When introducing a new, unknown external dependency for a critical function, we should first create a small, isolated "spike" test to validate its basic reliability *before* integrating it into the main application and TDD workflow. This would have identified the API's instability much earlier and saved significant development time.
